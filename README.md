# Chatbot made by Adam Satyshev IT-2302

# Overview
This project provides a real-time chat application built in Python that allows users to interact with a Large Language Model (LLM) through a web browser. The application uses Streamlit for the front-end interface and integrates LLM called Ollama to generate responses. All chat queries and responses will be stored in a vector store for retrieval and analysis using a database called ChromaDB.
